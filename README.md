# Language_Detection
This is a neural network that was created in 2018 for Honors Computer Science IV.
The neural network uses TensorFlow to classify whether a word is german, english, spanish, or italian.
All data is obtained from the Leipzig Corpora Collection.

The .exe is located within the executable folder and must be run in the same location as the contents of the folder, preferably within the executable folder. Since the neural network must retrain, give it a minute to run.

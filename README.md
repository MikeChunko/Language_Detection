# Language_Detection
This is a neural network that was created in 2018 for Honors Computer Science IV.
The neural network uses TensorFlow to classify whether a word is in German, English, Spanish, or Italian.
All data is obtained from the Leipzig Corpora Collection.

# Release
This branch contains only the .py, .java, and executable files (along with the data necessary for the .exe)
The other branches contain other files useful in editing the code.

# Running It
In order to run the executable download the repository and run executable/estimator.exe.
Note that the program will not accept input for a few minutes as it must train the neural network.
